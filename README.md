SIDIUS PROJECT is a captive portal made with the objective to have an easy installation and configuration on any Linux machine. It is aimed to public commerces and premises that have a considerable amount of people at day, e.g.: Airports, Hotel lobbies...

## Requirements

  - Updated Linux machine (Ubuntu Server recommended!)
  - Two network interfaces
  - Non self-signed SSL certificate (without this, the browser will detect the captive portal as MITM. You can use Let's Encrypt for free)
  
## Installation

There are <strong>TWO</strong> options to install the captive portal.

 If you want to modify some specific option, value or simply you want to know how it works. (WARNING! it can be a bit boring...)
 
 - [Manual]()
    
If you want to have it installed quickly and ready to work.    

 - [Setup script]()
